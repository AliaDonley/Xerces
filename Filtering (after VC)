where lyg differs from alexis 

Filtering vcf file to align lygdamus to alexis and get rid of all snps that dont match with 90% confidence 
only filtering for homozygotes, leaving hererozygotes where alleles with both detected in lydamus were detected

##why didn't this work?

##had to check this first to see if this ran and it did
